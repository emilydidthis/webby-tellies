So, for this project, I have several paragraphs that I want to *cycle* through.

## Dumb Version
I know that I can copy and paste each paragraph into a new HTML, and create links between the pages. That's easy. Let's do that for v1.

## Aspirational Version
It would be cool to have my Javascript be able to read the text from the markdown, create an array of the different paragraphs (split at the line separator) and upon clicking, cycle through the paragraphs in a loop. Or, to dynamically create new HTML pages at the line separation. 

Next level: would be cool to specify by what kind of break (separator or classic line) and what you want it to do (cycle or make new HTML pages).
