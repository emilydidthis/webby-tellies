    <p>Um.</p>
    <p>… to be honest, I’m not prepared to share.</p>
    <p>The original offer was admittedly just for show.</p>
    <p>I guess I don’t believe that people can be truly interested in me –
    in getting deeper. Or rather, I know what it’s like to expect that and
    to have it not be met – how painful that feels.</p>
    <p>It’s easier then to cut myself off prematurely and let myself engage
    in a surface-level relationship with you – to assume that’s what you
    want, too.</p>
    <p>God forbid, you’re actually invested in me, only to have what I show
    you be incredibly unimpressive.</p>
    <p>So, I’ve concluded it’s best to just not deliver at all.</p>
    <p>… you are here, though, I guess. You’ve made it this far.</p>
    <p>So, maybe I’ll open up, just this once:</p>
    <p>Since you're interested in seeing my work, please click <a href="index-01.html">here</a>.</p>
