<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Sorry, I got flustered.</p>
<p>I’m just surprised you actually clicked.</p>
<p>Give me a second to pull things up.</p>
<p>Okay, you can check my work out <strong><em>here</em></strong>.</p>
<p>… so you REALLY are interested.</p>
<p>Hold on.</p>
<p>Alright, <strong><em>here</em></strong> it is</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>… to be honest, I’m not prepared to share.</p>
<p>The original offer was admittedly just for show.</p>
<p>I guess I don’t believe that people can be truly interested in me –
in getting deeper. Or rather, I know what it’s like to expect that and
to have it not be met – how painful that feels.</p>
<p>It’s easier then to cut myself off prematurely and let myself engage
in a surface-level relationship with you – to assume that’s what you
want, too.</p>
<p>God forbid, you’re actually invested in me, only to have what I show
you be incredibly unimpressive.</p>
<p>So, I’ve concluded it’s best to just not deliver at all.</p>
<p>… you are here, though, I guess. You’ve made it this far.</p>
<p>So, maybe I’ll open up, just this once:</p>
