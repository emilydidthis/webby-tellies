# How Far I'll Go

I cannot believe how mean you were to me (but I guess it's my fault because I let you be).

I don't want to see you this weekend (and I'm terrible for it because that means I've just been leading you on)

I have really good ideas (that I never execute on because I'm lazy and procrastinate)

I deserve love (when I'm at my best)

I'm a good friend and partner (but could always be better)

I am capable (but only if you think so)

It's not your fault (but it is)
