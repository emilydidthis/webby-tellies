      <p>How do you know when to ask for help?</p>

      <p>
        Some people just go for it, without hesitation. “I need help,” they say.
        They’re not afraid. It’s simple: “I am struggling and therefore I will
        seek the assistance of others.” But how do they know they need it?
      </p>

      <p>
        When is the point at which a task becomes outside the scope of your
        capabilities? Is it once you’ve exhausted your own resources? Then, and
        only then, do you turn toward outward? That sounds about right.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, can we really know when we’ve reached our own limits? How do we
        know that we’ve tried hard enough? Maybe we’re just being lazy, and
        looking for someone to tell us the way. I think we could all stand to
        try a bit harder before giving up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Others, I’ve observed, wait until it’s offered. They struggle, but they
        don’t necessarily try to hide it. “Oh, little old me over here? Do I need
        help? Well shucks, if you’re offering!” This is maybe the best scenario,
        because you can be sure that you’re not bothering anyone. Just make sure
        your dramatics aren’t <i>too</i> obvious; otherwise, it’s basically the
        same as petitioning for help, but in a much less straightforward way. And
        that’s more annoying than just having asked in the first place.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Then, there are those who never seek help. Perhaps they’re determined to work it
        out themselves, or maybe the just didn’t need it in the first place –
        they’re completely self-sufficient.
      </p>

        Me? Mabel? I can’t say for certain
        when I need help or not. But generally, I err on the side of not asking,
        just in case. I think I’m strong enough to figure it out myself. People
        have enough to worry about in their own lives, and the last thing I want
        to do is trouble people with my mundane problems. Honestly, I don’t even
        really have it that bad. All my problems are self-inflicted. So therefore,
        it’s up to me to fix them. I can’t expect anyone to have sympathy for
        that; I can’t expect people to care. Everyone’s gotta focus on themselves,
        because “me” is number one.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        So yeah, all this to say, I’ve got this. I can
        handle my own. I’ll let you know if I need any help, but for now, I’m
        good.
