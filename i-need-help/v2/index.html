      <p id="text">Others, I’ve observed, wait until it’s offered. They struggle, but they
        don’t necessarily try to hide it. “Oh, little old me over here? Do I need
        help? Well shucks, if you’re offering!” This is maybe the best scenario,
        because you can be sure that you’re not bothering anyone. Just make sure
        your dramatics aren’t <i>too</i> obvious; otherwise, it’s basically the
        same as petitioning for help, but in a much less straightforward way. And
        that’s more annoying than just having asked in the first place.
