            <p>Mabel was antsy, or perhaps she was bored.</p>
            <p>"Have you seen that new show on Netflix?" Candy said loudly over the loud bar music.</p>
            <p>"Oh, my god. Yeah the traveling circus docuseries? Holy shit it's so good." </p>
            <p> Mabel had seen it, and thought it was exploitative, but remained silent.</p>
            <p> "The elephant part?"</p>
            <p> "Oh, man, the elephant part!"</p>
            <p> Candy and Hayden fidgeted enthusiastically in their seats. Mabel grinned forcefully, trying not to look too disengaged.</p>
            <p> "Have you seen it?" Hayden looked eagerly toward Mabel.</p>
            <p> "Yeah, I have. It's really good," Mabel lied. </p>
            <p> "Yeah!" Candy and Hayden nodded vigorously, hyped up by additional approval. </p>
            <p> <i>What I would give to just be at home</i>, Mabel groaned to herself. </p>

            <p>Mabel was antsy, or perhaps she was bored.</p>
            <p>Draped over the couch, she opened Netflix. "#1 in America today: Cirque" the banner read. She flicked past it, searching for other options. </p>
            <p>As title after title went by, Mabel's eyes glazed over. Her thumb went on auto-pilot, and her mind drifted into a dark abyss of nothingness.  </p>
            <p> Upon reassociating, Mabel exited Netflix and opened up her other streaming apps one by one, only to do the same empty scrolling on each platform. </p>
            <p> Eventually, Mabel returned to Netflix and tapped on Cirque. As the opening credits played, animal prints and circus patterns morphing into one in other in kaleidescope fashion, Mabel left and returned with some chips. She wiggled into the couch, trying to find a comfortable position. Disasstisfied, she unbuttoned her pants, waited a few seconds, and then opted to take them off entirely. She ripped open the bag and inhaled the oily, crisp air and sighed with pleasure. </p>
            <p> Mabel was in her element. The show just had to be good and it would be perfect.</p>
