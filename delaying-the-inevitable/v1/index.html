    <p>“So… do you think we should not be together then?” Annie picked at the logo of her empty coffee cup.</p>
    <p>“What? Why would you say that? What do you mean? Not be together?” Jason sat across from her, back to a cafe window. Outside, the sun shone brightly and New York City carried on, as if it were any Sunday morning.</p>
    <p>“I mean… break up,” Annie finally said. At the same time, she managed to finally unraveled the sleeve of the cup. It looked so naked now. </p>
    <p>Jason fell silent. How did they get here? This was supposed to be a nice date.</p>
    <p>“But, we don’t hate each other,” Jason finally said.</p> 
    <p>“No, we don’t,” Annie replied.</p> 
    <p>“We’re having a wonderful weekend together.”</p>
    <p>“We really are,” and with this Annie reached out to Jason across the way, closing the nauseating distance that had been building up between the two. Her hands met his and he clasped onto them tight. The two’s previously averted gazes finally found each other, as well, tears glistening in both sets of eyes.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been working so hard,” Annie continued. “And I wouldn’t work this hard with anyone else. I love you, Jason. So so much. But I don’t think we need to suffer anymore. We’re meant to live life together, like this,” she raised their joint hands, “Being five thousand miles apart does us no good.”</p>
    <p>“I can still try to take that position–“</p>
    <p>“Babe, we had that conversation months ago. You decided, we decided, that that was not it.”</p>
    <p>Jason frowned. She wasn’t wrong. He gripped Annie’s hands harder, in anger. “It’s just not fair,” he replied.</p>
    <p>Annie’s lips began to tremble. Being the voice of reason was tiresome. And painful. But Jason would never be able to do it. So she inhaled and exhaled deeply, trying to calm herself down. </p>
    <p>It was if Jason could sense this burden, so he took the next turn. He pushed away the intense desire to fight, as that was what his response had been time and time again over the past three years. But he could feel it too. It was time to let go.</p>
    <p>“You’re amazing. I’m so proud of you,” he said to Annie. “I’m so excited for what you do next.”</p>
    <p>“And you’re going to be great as well.” Annie walked around the table and sat beside Jason. The two embraced. Who knows how much time passed. Minutes, hours, days, but they eventually let go, because they were finally ready. </p>
